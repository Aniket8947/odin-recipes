      <li> 4 cups water </li>
      <li> 1 cup sugar </li>
      <li>500 ml whole milk  </li>
      <li>5-6 green cardamom pods peeled and crushed to get the powder  </li>

    </ul>
    <h2> METHOD</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Boil milk in a heavy bottom pan.Once it comes to a boil, switch off the flame and add 1/2 cup of water to bring the temperature of the milk down a bit. </li>
      <li> Wait for 5-10 minutes and then start adding lemon juice till milk curdles. </li>
      <li> Add lemon juice till the milk curdles completely. </li>
      <li> Using a strainer drain the water and collect the chena. </li>
      <li> Rinse it under tap water so that there's no trace of lemon juice in it. </li>
      <li> Leave it in the strainer for 10-15 minutes and then take the chena in your hand and squeeze out remaining water slowly. </li>
      <li> Add cornflour and start mashing the chena till it’s smooth. </li>
      <li> Set the clock to 10 minutes and mash constantly for 10 minutes using your palm. Once it’s smooth, make small balls out of it. </li>
      <li> Heat 1 cup sugar and 4 cups water in a wide pan and wait till it comes to a full boil. Drop the balls in boiling sugar syrup and cook for 15-17 minutes.  </li>
      <li> In a heavy bottom pan, boil 500 ml of milk. </li>
      <li> Soak few strands of saffron in a tablespoon of warm milk and set aside. </li>
      <li> Once the milk comes to a boil, lower the flame and continue to stir the milk at regular intervals. After 10 minutes add sugar and mix. </li>
      <li> After 20-25 minutes the milk will thicken to desired consistency, add soaked saffron and crushed cardamom. </li>
      <li> Also add finely chopped pistachios [if using]. Mix and switch off the flame. </li>
      <li> Take out the cooled down rasmalai balls from the fresh water bowl. Squeeze and flatten lightly using your hands and put in sugar syrup for around 10-15 minutes </li>
      <li> Squeeze the balls carefully as they are very soft and can break easily.  </li>
      <li> Transfer the balls to thickened milk [milk should be warm]. </li>
      <li> Chill in the refrigerator overnight or for 5-6 hours. Garnish with chopped pistachios and few saffron strands before serving. </li>

    </ul>
